			<h2>About Banksy</h2>
			<p id="tribute-info">While Mr. Banksy needs no formal introduction in this day and age, we must take time and remember that there may come a day when he will no longer be in living memory. Mr. Banksy, AKA Master Paws, AKA Dali Catana, was the first feline to reach kitten nirvana.</p>
			<h3>Birth</h3>
			<p>Banksy was born to Mrs. Fluffington on June 6, 2010. His father remains unknown but is suspected to be of excellent breed. It is said that Banksy was first inline to be born, but in an act of kindness allowed his brothers and sisters to see their new world first.</p>
